## 2. About Us Page (`/about`)

```md
# About Yametee

### Who We Are  
Yametee is an anime-inspired streetwear brand based in the Philippines.  
Our name comes from a playful twist on the Japanese phrase *“yamete kudasai”*, but our goal is serious:

To create high-quality, comfortable, and stylish anime tees that fans are proud to wear anywhere—hindi lang sa bahay, pero kahit sa mall, school, o night-out.

### What We Stand For  
- **Premium feel, everyday comfort** – We carefully choose fabric and print quality so your shirts feel good and last longer.  
- **Anime-first designs** – Every graphic is inspired by iconic moments, characters, and scenes from the anime world.  
- **Clean, modern streetwear** – Minimalist cuts and colors (black, white, red) that still look good even if people don’t know the anime reference.

### Why We Started  
We’re anime fans too. We got tired of low-quality, generic prints and wanted something that feels like legit streetwear—but with anime soul.

Yametee is our way of bringing that mix of **Japanese pop culture + everyday streetwear** to your wardrobe.

### Built for the Community  
We listen to our community when we create new drops—what shows you’re watching, which characters you love, and what style you vibe with.

Every purchase supports a local team of designers, printers, and staff who love anime as much as you do.
